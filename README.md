We intend to make a program that makes a button move away from your mouse in a dialog box so you can't press it.

## New Feature Planned: Escape the Window
Our stretch goals for this project include a bonus feature where the button escapes out of the program window and starts running around on your desktop.

# Additional Upcoming Feature - Time Limit
Once the button escapes the application window you only have 60 seconds to press it or it forcibly shuts down the computer.
