# CS305_Module5
A repository that exists solely for purposes of the assignment.
Uses the Creative Commons Zero license because we can.

We intend to make a program that makes a button move away from your mouse in a dialog box so you can't press it.

## NEW: Time Limit
Once the application starts, you only have 60 seconds to press the button or our program forcibly shuts down the computer.

## New Feature Planned: Escape the Window
Our stretch goals for this project include a bonus feature where the button escapes out of the program window and starts running around on your desktop.

# Newer Feature: Distributing Coat to Axolotls
An app to give coats to axolotls that are also waterproof.
